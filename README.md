2. Begin with the end in mind
        Start with a juicy goal
3. put first things first
        Break it down
4. Think win win
5. Seek first to understand, then to be understood
6. Synergise
7. Sharpen the shaw
8. find your voice and inspire others to find theirs

#### Listening
Listening
•	Cosmetic – not focused on the speaker
•	Conversational – acknowledges the speaker
•	Active – you are aware of the speaker at a bigger level.
•	Deep – You are heavily invested in the person, you know all the parts of the faces
More listening
Concentrate on the speaker
Don’t think about your response too much
Interaction non-verbally such as nodding
Don’t interrupt – don’t finish other person’s sentences – it breaks your concentration.
•	How can I help you to make it easier to the other person

Was your trip successful?

Open questions
Questions that are open to detail

What led up to that?
What did you manage to accomplish on your trip?
In what ways does the candidate meet our needs?
What happened at the meeting?

Closing questions
Come to conclusions
These aim at removing ambiguity

What are our next actions on this?
What is it, that is topping you from doing this today?

Always have an agenda or set the next action

Cognitive biases
Biases that we have that are inherent.

Every peoples brains are different

o	confirmation bias – search for the thing you know its true
o	supportive bias – reinforcing their chosen decision and blocking out other decisions.
•	Not enough meaning
o	Authority bias – they are in authority so what they say must be true
o	Outcome bias – judge situation on outcome instead of the actions
o	Bandwagon effect – following someone else
•	Need to act fast
•	What should we remember?

Exploiting bias in the workplace

•	Reactance – telling people they are able to say no will make them more likely to say yes
•	Reciprocity – be the first to give
o	The feeling of obligation to give when you receive
o	Personalised and unexpected makes it even better
•	Door in the face – forcing people to refuse a large request increases the likelihood of agreeing to a second, smaller request
•	Likeability – gives complements and build coorperation
•	The bystander effect – people look to others to determine their own actions

Iteration – perform actions repeatedly
